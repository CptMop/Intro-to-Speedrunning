							<h2><a href="index.html">Welcome to Speedrunning</a></h2>
							<img src="images/clock.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft" /><p>You may have heard the term “Speedrunning” before and wonder what on earth is it? To put it simply, speedrunning is playing a game from start to finish as fast as possible. But there’s so much more to it than just going fast. While I’m no professional by any means, I have been interested in speedrunning for years now and I want to help introduce it to more people for those who are curious about trying it out or even just getting into watching others run the games.</p>

							<h2><a href="#">Getting Started</a></h2>
							<p>First and foremost, speedrunning is a hobby. Although some have used it to help them stream full time and turn it into a job, the fact remains that it’s a fun pastime for many and really isn’t that hard to get into at all. As with most hobbies, you can be as serious or non serious about it as much as you want. It all depends on how much work you’re willing to put into it so it’s important to look into games that you can see yourself playing numerous times without getting bored.</p>
							
							<p>If you do decide to get into speedrunning, the best places to learn are sites such as speedrun.com and speedrunslive.com where you can not only watch a bunch of speedruns to learn from but also can check out the forums, discord channels and so on to get into the community. </p>

							If you do decide to get into speedrunning, the best places to learn are sites such as speedrun.com and speedrunslive.com where you can not only watch a bunch of speedruns to learn from but also can check out the forums, discord channels and so on to get into the community. 
						</p>
						<p>
							<a href="https://www.speedrun.com/">Speedrun.com</a> in particular has a lot of information on not only how to get started speedrunning a game, but also what programs to get if you decide to stream yourself running a game. It also has rules for each game and category (determined by the community) so you know how to make sure that your run is allowed and won’t be accidentally breaking any rules to be eligible for the leaderboards (<a href="https://www.speedrun.com/sm64#120_Star">Example</a>).
						</p>
						<p>
							<a href="http://www.speedrunslive.com/">Speedrunslive.com</a> is really good to help introduce you to new streamers as it shows you a bunch of them currently speedrunning live whenever you go to visit the site. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Another good way to get into speedrunning is to watch the bi-annual charity marathon event, <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/">Awesome Games Done Quick and Summer Games Done Quick</a>. Every Winter and Summer, this event features numerous speedrunners and it goes on for about a week. They have runs going on at all times during the week where they run to earn money for charity with AGDQ’s charity being the Prevent Cancer Foundation and SGDQ supporting the Doctors without Borders Foundation.
						</p>
						<p>
							Youtube also has a lot of resources with speedrun and stream recordings from AGDQ, SGDQ, previous and current world record speedruns, as well as tutorials.

					<p>As you can tell, speedrunning is very accessible and while it does have some rules, it’s all in good fun and to make sure everyone and everything is on an even playing field. You can be competitive with other players by beating their time or competitive with yourself by constantly working on improving your time and skill level. It’s a lot of fun to watch and a lot of fun to get into and I highly recommend it.</p>
