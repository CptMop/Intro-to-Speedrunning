							<h2><a href="terms.html">Terms</a></h2>
							<p>Whether you get into running or just watching, it helps to learn some of the terms. The most common include different category names, and the names of general glitches.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
							<h2><i>Common Categories</i></h2>
							<p>
									<b>Any% (any percent)</b> - This category refers to getting to the end of the game regardless of what percentage of the game you may have finished with. This category is typically used with a fair amount of glitches and are usually the shortest to complete.
									
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>100% (hundred percent)</b> - This refers to completing the game 100% in terms of items, challenges, quests, or whatever else the game has to meet that requirement. 100% still tends to use a wide variety of glitches to finish in as short as time as possible but the runs tend to take at least a few hours depending on the game being run.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Deathless</b> - As the name suggests, this is a run that requires the runner goes through the whole game without dying a single time. This is done typically to impose a bigger challenge for the runner.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Glitchless</b> - Refers to playing the game as intended without using any skips or glitches to bypass certain obstacles. 
							</p>
							<p>
									Beyond these categories, some games will have numerous others that are more of a challenge and aren’t seen nearly as much. Games such as Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, have special categories such as MST (Medallions, Stones, Trials) which refers to collecting all the medallions, stones and completing all the trials before completing the game. This does not fall under 100% as not all items are required but has more requirements than any%.

					<h2><i>Common Terms and Glitches</i></h2>
					<p>
							<b>Auto-Scroller</b> - There are some games that have a section that moves at a predetermined pace. These sections usually cannot be sped up with either skill or glitches and are often called the most boring part of a run.
					</p>
					<p>
							<b>Buffer</b> - Buffering is when you input an action while another is currently going on. This is done so that an action can be executed on the first frame possible and very useful for any frame perfect tricks.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Clip</b> - Clipping is when you use a glitch to go through something that should be solid in the game. This is usually done with walls or floors and can often lead to getting out of bounds which can let the runner skip huge parts of a game.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Collision Box</b> - In games, objects have what’s called a collision box which determines how solid and object is supposed to be. When two collision boxes touch, they stop moving. Certain exploits can happen when a gap is found between these collision boxes.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Cutscene Skips</b> - Most games do not have a built in “skip movie” function when cutscenes play. In speedruns cutscenes are mostly time wasters and as such, runners will use glitches that will automatically skip the next cutscene to help save time.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Damage Boost</b> - Sometimes when you get hit in games, you will be knocked back and this is sometimes used in runs to help the runner move faster or help get to areas they can’t access normally. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Death Warp</b> - This is when the runner purposely dies to warp back to a checkpoint instead of having to walk back. There are also other uses such as quickly ending a fight or to help trigger certain glitches.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Emulator</b> - Programs made to mimic a game console. Runners usually only use these if they want to practice because they can use save states (similar to saving regularly in game except it also saves what frame/position you were in). Certain Emulators are not allowed for speedrunning as they may load faster than on console and so if you want to speedrun on an emulator it’s important to check to see which ones are and are not allowed.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>FPS</b> - If you’ve heard the term 60 fps, 30 fps or anything of the sort, this means “frames per second”. Videos, animations and games all run on a certain fps and in terms of speedrunning can affect how certain glitches or tricks are pulled off. Modern games typically run on 60 fps and are very smooth to watch/play where as older games run at 30 fps or lower. If a run has a frame perfect trick on the route, runners will typically use a buffer (such as pausing the game repeatedly to get the correct frame) or if it has settings you can change, the runner may change some settings to lower or speed up the fps (depending on what’s needed) to execute the trick.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Glitch</b> - Sometimes referred to as an exploit or trick, a glitch is when a game acts in a way it was not supposed to by the developers.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Hit Box</b> - Every model in a video game has these hit boxes that determine when they are being hit and when to take damage.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>In Game Time</b> - Because a lot of video games have cutscenes or require a runner to go into the menu a lot, some speedruns will measure by in game time which is the game’s internal clock rather than using an outside timer like with most other speedruns.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Input Lag</b> - Often caused by monitors or when there’s too many objects on the screen/frame at once, it’s when a character’s action is lagging behind the player’s inputs.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Invincibility Frames</b> - Certain games will give you these invincibility frames after you’ve just been hit and runners may sometimes abuse this to skip fights or certain areas of the game.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Manipulation</b> - Using specific movements or actions in a game to influence aspects of the game. One of the main examples of this is to manipulate how a boss fights to make it easier.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Out of Bounds</b> - When you managed to push yourself out of the normal boundaries of a game. This helps runners skip huge parts of the current level.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Overflow and Underflow</b> - Using exploits to change how the game handles variables. Example, overflowing the game with the same item numerous times to spawn something completely different.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>RNG</b> - Standing for Random Number Generator, many games have a luck factor that runners either need to manipulate or if they’re unable to do so, just hope they get lucky. This is not reliant on the skill of the runner at all and can cause a huge time loss if you’re unlucky.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Save Warp</b> - When the runner saves the game and then resets the console/reloads the game to save time instead of travelling there normally.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Soft-Lock</b> - Sometimes when you’re playing through a game even casually, the game can be glitched out and prevents the player from completed. The game itself does not consider this a crash and will try to play like normal but it always requires a reset. This includes required items spawning/being pushed to a place inaccessible to the player, the player getting stuck in an object unable to leave and so on.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>TAS</b> - Tool Assisted Speedruns are speedruns that use an emulator with save states as well as being able to move frame by frame to simulate a perfect speedrun.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Tech</b> - Speedrun strategies that know how a game functions/operates in order to break it.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Wall Clip</b> - Very similar to Out of Bounds but refers to clipping through a wall.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Warp</b> - An action that takes you from one area or place in a game to another without having to travel there “manually”.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>WR</b> - World Record speedruns that have the fastest speedrun for a game at that current time.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Wrong Warp</b> - Similar to warping, wrong warp is when you perform a glitch that causes a normal warp to take you somewhere completely different than intended.
